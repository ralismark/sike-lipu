This was a webring that was started in mid 2021 for fans of toki pona that were in the ma pona discord server.
Unfortunately due to other commitments in her life, the maintainer of this has decided to decommission it in early 2022.

This repo contains the source code for the webring, and uses Jekyll in novel ways to:

- allow for easy addition of new members, requiring only the addition of a single file in `_people`; and
- provide a fully static widget that linked to the websites of other people in the webring.

This repo still showcases how the above are implemented.
The webring can be run locally using the `serve.sh` script and accessed at `http://localhost:5000`, provided that docker is installed.
